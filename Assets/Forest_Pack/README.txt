About scripts,

"CampfireLightBounce" - causes campfire light flickering, have three variables, noise (how much the light is flickering), Range Up/Down (range of light intensity, standard min 0-8 max). Please note that in script there is written 'element', so the material order depends on the mesh renderer elements.

"ChangeMaterialsColor_Instant" - changes diffuse color in selected number of materials to chosen color when the game starts. For example when asset have three materials, You can put this script on it, select first three checkboxes and then set the desire color under selected checkboxes. 

Please note that in script there is written 'element', so the material order depends on the mesh renderer elements.

"ChangeMaterialsColor_Pulse" - changes diffuse color in selected number of materials to choosen color during certain period of time back and forth. For example when asset have three materials, You can put this script on it, select first three checkboxes and then set the desire color under selected checkboxes.Also You can set 'Time to change' - how fast the color will bounce between selected values. 

"Water_waves" - similar as color scripts above, You can use this on water planes - it bounces between two colors drugin certain amount of time, using material elements.
